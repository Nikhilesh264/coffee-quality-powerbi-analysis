# Coffee Quality Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing coffee sensory scores, processing methods, and defects to identify factors driving coffee quality and specialty grading.


## Project Overview
This project explores coffee quality evaluation data from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) to identify the key factors that influence specialty-grade coffee scores.

An interactive Power BI dashboard was built to analyze sensory attributes, processing techniques, country of origin, and defect occurrences to understand what drives higher quality coffee and what reduces it.

## Business Questions Solved
- What determines higher coffee quality scores?
- Which countries produce better quality coffee?
- Which processing methods perform best?
- How much do defects impact final cup score?

## Key Insights
- Average cup score: 83.7
- 98.6% samples classified as specialty grade
- Washed processing methods show slightly higher average scores
- Coffees with defects score ~3 points lower on average

## Dashboard Features
- KPI summary cards
- Top countries by quality
- Processing method comparison
- Defect impact analysis
- Interactive filtering

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- DAX Measures
- Data Modeling
- Data Cleaning (Power Query)
- Business Intelligence & Visualization
